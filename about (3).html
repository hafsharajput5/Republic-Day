Honorable teachers and my dear friends,
Warm greetings to everyone on the occasion of 26th January – Republic Day.
Today is a very proud day for our country because on this day in 1950, the Constitution of India came into force, and India became a sovereign democratic republic. Our Constitution gives us the rights of equality, freedom, and justice.
Republic Day reminds us of our great freedom fighters and the makers of our Constitution such as <span>Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, Mahatma Gandhi, and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, </span>who dedicated their lives to the nation.
Today, we should all take a pledge to be responsible citizens, follow the rules of our country, and contribute to making India a better nation.
Let us all say together—
<span>Jai Hind! Jai Bharat!🫡🇮🇳</span>
